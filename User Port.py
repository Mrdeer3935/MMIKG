Integrate the existing knowledge of the gut-brain axis and present it in the form
 of a knowledge graph, which is called MMiKG. In this research, our team collected 
 critical knowledge by reading a large amount of literature and mined the GraphXR 
 platform and Neo4j database for visualization and implicit information, respectively.

    - Whereas, there is still mass of information not contained in MMiKG and the predicting results are not 100% accurate, which only provide a referring evidence for biological and clinical experiment.
